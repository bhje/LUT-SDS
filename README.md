**LUT SDS Front End Developer Course**

**Name: Benjamin Hjelt**

**My Project: Photo Gallery**

How to run this project:
1. Clone the repository to a local folder.

2. Optional: Inside the gallery-images folder, most subfolders can be removed if they are too large.
However, please keep at least one or two to ensure the layout renders correctly.

3. Open the index.html file in a browser.
For example, you can use the built-in Live Server extension in VS Code to preview the site.

4. Done! You should now be able to view and interact with the page and its features.

(Alternatively, use the pages site: https://bhje.github.io/LUT-SDS/)


**Planning:**

Parts:
- Menu bar
  - Shortcuts to different parts of the page
- Hero page
  - Introductory image
  - "Gallery" written on top
- Gallery
  - Sorted by year (23-25)
  - Or by subject matter? TBD
  - Perhaps just a slide show
  - Wonder if I could upload meta data some way smooth
- Footer
  - Some kind of redo of the course guide
  - Align things better


Specific changes (comparing to tutorial page)
- Align text better in footer
- Functional links
- Menu bar always in view? Maybe
