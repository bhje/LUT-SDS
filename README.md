LUT Front End Developer Course
My Project: Photo Gallery

Parts:
- Menu bar
  - Shortcuts to different parts of the page
- Hero page
  - Introductory image
  - "Gallery" written on top
- Gallery
  - Sorted by year (23-25)
  - Or by subject matter? TBD
  - Perhaps just a slide show
  - Wonder if I could upload meta data some way smooth
- Footer
  - Some kind of redo of the course guide
  - Align things better


Specific changes (comparing to tutorial page)
- Align text better in footer
- Functional links
- Menu bar always in view? Maybe
