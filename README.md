**LUT SDS Front End Developer Course**

**Name: Benjamin Hjelt**

**My Project: Photo Gallery**

How to run this project:
1. Download the files:
1.1 Most folders inside of the folder "gallery-images" are optional.
   Please download at least one or two of them to complete the layout of the page.
2. Host the file index.html in a browser, for example using the built in host function in VSCode
3. Done! You can now view the page and its features.
   (Alternatively, use the pages site: https://bhje.github.io/LUT-SDS/)

**Planning:**

Parts:
- Menu bar
  - Shortcuts to different parts of the page
- Hero page
  - Introductory image
  - "Gallery" written on top
- Gallery
  - Sorted by year (23-25)
  - Or by subject matter? TBD
  - Perhaps just a slide show
  - Wonder if I could upload meta data some way smooth
- Footer
  - Some kind of redo of the course guide
  - Align things better


Specific changes (comparing to tutorial page)
- Align text better in footer
- Functional links
- Menu bar always in view? Maybe
